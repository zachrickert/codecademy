## Prework for CodeFellows Python 401
#### Work from Codcademy

Work to be completed:
* Unit 3:PygLatin - part 10
* Unit 4: Taking a Vacation - part 7
* Unit 5: A Day at the Supermarket - part 12
* Unit 6: Student Becomes the Teacher - part 9
* Unit 7: Battleship! - part 18

Each unit is in its own folder.  Also included is a Battleship 2 folder which is a work in progress to recreate the game battleship.

The work in codcademy was done a while ago.  For a refresher I did the work again on my own computer which is on python3.
