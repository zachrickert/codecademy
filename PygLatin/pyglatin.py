"""This is a Pig Latin Translator."""

"""Pig Latin is a language game, where the first letter of the word is moved to
 the end and add "ay."
So "Python" becomes "ythonpay."
Here are the steps to write a Pig Latin translator in Python:

* Ask the user to input a word in English.
* Make sure the user entered a valid word.
* Convert the word from English to Pig Latin.
* Display the translation result.
